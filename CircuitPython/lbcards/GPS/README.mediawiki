* Modified [http://land-boards.com/blwiki/index.php?title=PulseGen PulseGen] card
** Oscillator circuit removed (not used as pulse generator)
** Receives input from GPS output and drives 50 Ohm output on BNC
* Status LED
** Blinks in for 1 second at power up
** Goes off until serial communications are working
** Blinks on-off as data is received from GPS while waiting for Satellite signal lock
** LED is on solid once output is enabled
